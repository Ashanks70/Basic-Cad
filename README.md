## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

### Reflection
The fork was rather simple and just required using fillet and chamfer, which round down edges.

## Tire

### Description
The tire was simply a revolved trapezoid, which was hard to make.

### Reflection
This one was slightly more tricky and I had to follow along in the video.

## Wheel

### Description
I made the inside part of a wheel which I struggled with.

### Reflection
This one was really hard. I started off on the wrong plane but doing it next to the tire helped.
